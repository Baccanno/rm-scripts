# rm-scripts
Utility scripts for Remarkable tablet

## Installation
Just pick the scripts that you want and put upload them on your remarkable. Then you could either use [genie](https://github.com/rmkit-dev/rmkit/tree/master/src/genie) or ssh on the tablet and manually launch them.

## clean_deleted
Files are not properly cleared even when I empty the trash, I don't really know why, but anyway I made this script to clean all files marked as deleted.
usage : `./clean_deleted`
